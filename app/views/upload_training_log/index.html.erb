<h1>File Upload</h1>
<p>Currently, Fitcharts only accepts a log file from RunningAHEAD.  Here are the steps to export your training log.</p>
<p>1. Go to RunningAHEAD -> Tools -> Download training data to your computer.</p>
<p>2. Select XML (ideal for backups).</p>
<p>3. Unzip that puppy and extract the log.xml file.</p>
<p>4. Come back here and upload it.</p>
<%= form_for :upload_file, :html => {:multipart => true} do |f| %>
  <%= f.file_field :uploaded_file %>
  <%= f.submit "Upload" %>
<% end %>
